# testing-complex-task-markdown

Don't need a shortdesc here, but adding anyway.

1.  Here's the first step of a complex task.Here's \(something in parens\) in the info element following the first step. `# /opt/teradata/client/version/dsa/barnc-init` where version is the version of DSU you are configuring. A prompt displays.
2.  a step with an image inline of a scr-schot.

3.  From your SSH client console, log on to the DSU instance as `ec2-user` using the applicable AWS key pair. 

    ```
    # ssh -i  private-key-file  ec2-user@public-DNS  or  public-IP
    					
    ```

    where:

    -    private-key-file is the private key file \(.pem\) of the AWS key pair specified when launching the DSU instance.
    -    public-DNS is the public DNS name or public-IP is the public IP address of the DSU instance.
4.  From your SSH client console, log on to the DSU instance as `ec2-user` using the applicable AWS key pair. 

    ```
    # ssh -i  private-key-file  ec2-user@public-DNS  or  public-IP
    					
    ```

    where:

    -    private-key-file is the private key file \(.pem\) of the AWS key pair specified when launching the DSU instance.
    -    public-DNS is the public DNS name or public-IP is the public IP address of the DSU instance.
5.  Enter the name of the server.For example, prodApp-1. The script appends \_media to the name. Another prompt displays.
6.  Enter the IP address for the server running tdactivemq for Teradata DSU.This IP address is the same as the DSC server that is running. For example, 9.8.7.6. The script verifies the connection to this IP address on ports 61616 and 15401. If successful, another prompt displays.
7.  If the connection to the IP address fails, run the script again and provide the correct IP address to configure and initialize ClientHandler.
8.  Enter the host name of the BarNC Web Services.This host name is the DNS name for the first TPA node. For example, ip-1-2-3-4.
9.  Here's step two of this complex task.Using this info element to put in a table.

    |Header row, cell 0-1|Header row, cell 1-1|
    |--------------------|--------------------|
    |Table row, cell 0-2paragraph in a table row, cell 0-2

    -   unordered list item 1 in table row, cell 0-2
|Table row, cell 1-2paragraph in a table row, cell 1-2

    1.  ordered list item 1 in a table row, cell 1-2
|
    |filepath in a table row, cell 0-3|cmdname in a table row, cell 1-3|
    |userinput in a table row, cell 0-4|cite in a table row, cell 1-4|
    |**uicontrol** in a table row, cell 0-5|**uicontrol** in a table row, cell 1-5|
    |Try a codeblock in this table row.    ```
    <xsl:call-template name="process-inline-contents"/>
   <xsl:call-template name="process-inline-contents"/>
    ```

|Try a codeph in this table row.`a little codeph`|

10. This step is followed by a stepresult.The stepresult following a cmd
11. Here's a filepath in a step, followed by a cmdname in a step, followed by userinput in a step, **uicontrol** in a step, ending with a cite in a step.This info directly follows the cmd in a step.
12. Using this step for a dl. 

    Between steps 4 and 6 with a definition list

    definition term 1
    :   definition description 1

    definition term 2
    :   definition description 2

13. We'll try a choicetable in this step

    |Choicetable header row, cell 0-1|Choicetable header row, cell 1-1|
    |--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
    |**Table row, cell 0-2paragraph in a table row, cell 0-2

    -   unordered list item 1 in table row, cell 0-2
**|Table row, cell 1-2paragraph in a table row, cell 1-2

    1.  ordered list item 1 in a table row, cell 1-2
|
    |**filepath in a table row, cell 0-3**|cmdname in a table row, cell 1-3|
    |**userinput in a table row, cell 0-4**|cite in a table row, cell 1-4|
    |****uicontrol** in a table row, cell 0-5**|**uicontrol** in a table row, cell 1-5|
    |**Try a codeblock in this table row.    ```
    <xsl:call-template name="process-inline-contents"/>
   <xsl:call-template name="process-inline-contents"/>
    ```

**|Try a codeph in this table row.`a little codeph`    1.  ordered list with a codeblock

        ```
    <xsl:call-template name="process-inline-contents"/>
   <xsl:call-template name="process-inline-contents"/>
        ```

    2.  ordered list with `a little codeph`.
